## Description & LIVE DEPLOYED WEBSITE
---
The app can be viewed live [here](https://catormerod.github.io/portfolio-react/).  For more information see below. 

This portfolio was a definite journey!  I started off using pages and use state to control the page change but found issues with integrating the nav link active status with reactstrap in this manner.  So I switched over to React-Router-Dom and found that that worked nicely and was quite easy to implement.  However, I then found I couldn't link directly into pages the way I wanted.  After consulting with some other students I found that this could be achieved through hashrouter.  

I then continued through my journey adding other libraries.  I found a lot of the libraries had documentation that was difficult to follow so went through a few of them before I found ones I liked!  

So here is the current result!  I'm open to new library recommendations to play around with - so fire me an email (contact details below!)
